a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .	0
jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .	0
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .	0
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .	0
puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .	0
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours .	0
this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .	0
the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '	0
as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan .	0
a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .	0
[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .	0
there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .	0
most of the action setups are incoherent .	0
schindler's list it ain't .	0
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .	0
a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale .	0
cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera .	0
adaptation is simply brilliant .	0
open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations .	0
a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .	0
. . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .	0
ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon	0
this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !	0
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	0
with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives .	0
although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be .	0
a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .	0
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .	0
a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life .	0
funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking .	0
writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal .	0
ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine .	0
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .	0
smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due .	0
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	0
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	0
it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .	0
a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking .	0
i admired this work a lot .	0
huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .	0
not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .	0
this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .	0
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .	0
a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .	0
high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .	0
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense .	0
. . . really horrible drek .	0
the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .	0
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .	0
by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors .	0
you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid .	0
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending .	0
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental .	0
feels shrill , simple and soapy .	0
white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .	0
an ugly , revolting movie .	0
eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants .	0
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti	0
the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .	0
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .	0
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations	0
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .	0
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .	0
a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .	0
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .	0
an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 .	0
the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half	0
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special .	0
despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .	0
feels like a cold old man going through the motions .	0
a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .	0
a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground	0
. . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .	0
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .	0
people cinema at its finest .	0
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .	0
morton is , as usual , brilliant .	0
it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .	0
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .	0
massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history .	0
garcÃ­a bernal and talancÃ³n are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out .	0
the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary .	0
made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental .	0
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .	0
what makes the movie work Â— to an admittedly limited extent Â— is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .	0
auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .	0
it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise .	0
that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .	0
bearable . barely .	0
just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .	0
an enjoyable above average summer diversion .	0
it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . .	0
everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .	0
it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .	0
the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful .	0
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .	0
occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .	0
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .	0
a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .	0
whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars	0
this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards .	0
everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .	0
as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .	0
beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve .	0
maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while .	0
[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	0
a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship .	0
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	0
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable	0
it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	0
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too .	0
just one bad idea after another .	0
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .	0
offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film .	0
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .	0
the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .	0
the film's performances are thrilling .	0
the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .	0
given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .	0
the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann .	0
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .	0
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .	0
the most consistently funny of the austin powers films .	0
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .	0
it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .	0
it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works .	0
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .	0
visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative .	0
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .	0
playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant .	0
an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular .	0
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .	0
it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .	0
occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .	0
not so much farcical as sour .	0
and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> .	0
professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .	0
a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel .	0
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .	0
pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .	0
audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .	0
dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag .	0
the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .	0
it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation .	0
the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .	0
without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed .	0
in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .	0
normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .	0
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct .	0
woefully pretentious .	0
shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material	0
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .	0
this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .	0
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .	0
terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life .	0
there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .	0
one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .	0
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .	0
partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .	0
a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .	0
an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy .	0
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .	0
ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .	0
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .	0
it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .	0
the date movie that franz kafka would have made .	0
while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest .	0
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .	0
viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .	0
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .	0
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'	0
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .	0
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .	0
the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .	0
. . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .	0
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .	0
strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .	0
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .	0
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	0
while guzmÃ¡n frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .	0
a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life .	0
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .	0
a bad movie that happened to good actors .	0
it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call .	0
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation .	0
the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .	0
a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm .	0
a very capable nailbiter .	0
nothing about it fits .	0
for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable .	0
if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .	0
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .	0
i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .	0
nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . .	0
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .	0
the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .	0
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .	0
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .	0
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .	0
the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .	0
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .	0
you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is .	0
first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .	0
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .	0
the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years .	0
ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . .	0
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .	0
the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .	0
a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .	0
even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice .	0
what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .	0
bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough .	0
a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .	0
nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . .	0
a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .	0
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .	0
the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script .	0
if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you .	0
at once half-baked and overheated .	0
'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '	0
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one .	0
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .	0
this is a film living far too much in its own head .	0
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .	0
the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .	0
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .	0
well-meant but unoriginal .	0
could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .	0
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .	0
a vivid cinematic portrait .	0
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work .	0
. . . salaciously simplistic .	0
this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .	0
the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .	0
may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .	0
when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .	0
. . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises .	0
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .	0
there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .	0
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .	0
birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .	0
. . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	0
the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .	0
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .	0
kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .	0
one of the worst films of 2002 .	0
it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance	0
the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller .	0
noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .	0
one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .	0
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .	0
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget .	0
brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable .	0
this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt .	0
rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker .	0
o Ãšltimo suspeito ganha forÃ§a ao tambÃ©m funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar .	0
an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .	0
[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion .	0
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .	0
enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary .	0
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naÃ¯f's encounter with the world .	0
this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family	0
the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert .	0
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .	0
a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales .	0
a ragbag of cliches .	0
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .	0
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .	0
the threat implied in the title pokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying Â– like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .	0
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .	0
it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .	0
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .	0
hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue .	0
it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .	0
[u]nrelentingly stupid .	0
. . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .	0
the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .	0
a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world .	0
viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes .	0
get out your pooper-scoopers .	0
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up .	0
the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .	0
[howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting .	0
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .	0

it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .	0
we get the comedy we settle for .	0
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	0

a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well .	0
works as pretty contagious fun .	0

like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .	0
there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note .	0
feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .	0
. . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .	0
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .	0

that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout .	0
the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .	0

uneven but a lot of fun .	0
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .	0
not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .	0

intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .	0

a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .	0
there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .	0
absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .	0

what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .	0

reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .	0
a well-crafted letdown .	0
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .	0

it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .	0
while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting .	0

the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen .	0
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .	0
an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great Â‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances	0
though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .	0

it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .	0
the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .	0
tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .	0

its sheer dynamism is infectious .	0
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	0
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it .	0
it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .	0

hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .	0
a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !	0
this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are .	0
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .	0
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .	0
a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone .	0
done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment .	0
a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke .	0

although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two .	0
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero .	0
its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway .	0
the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time .	0
brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life .	0
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .	0
qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .	0
. . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope .	0
the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .	0
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	0
this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .	0

it is quite a vision .	0

imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar .	0
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .	0
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller .	0
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	0
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .	0
seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but .	0

i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .	0
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .	0
the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard .	0
despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .	0

a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .	0
. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .	0
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .	0
the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard .	0

an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .	0
tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .	0

'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '	0

very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .	0
the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design .	0
with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hÃ©lÃ¨ne angel is definitely a director to watch .	0
the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .	0

the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .	0
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .	0
a wildly inconsistent emotional experience .	0
it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .	0
sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .	0
it strikes hardestÂ… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .	0

don't even bother to rent this on video .	0
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .	0
as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .	0
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .	0
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .	0

there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?	0
she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness .	0
director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question .	0
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	0
filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it .	0
[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .	0
hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .	0
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .	0
cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .	0
splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .	0

what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad .	0
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .	0
a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .	0

even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost .	0
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .	0
holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .	0
returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age .	0
all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .	0
it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .	0
rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout .	0
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .	0
a masterpiece four years in the making .	0
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional .	0
odd and weird .	0
a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .	0
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't .	0
even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing .	0
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .	0
this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .	0
poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak .	0
it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains .	0
the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .	0
the film is like sitting in a downtown cafÃ© , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .	0
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .	0
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	0
if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster .	0
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .	0
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .	0
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .	0
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .	0
wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .	0
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only .	0
funny but perilously slight .	0
it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .	0
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .	0
the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose .	0
grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors .	0
cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days	0
genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love .	0
if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 .	0
a creaky staircase gothic .	0
performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances .	0
a quiet , pure , elliptical film	0
even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules .	0
painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances .	0
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .	0
by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .	0
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art .	0
you live the mood rather than savour the story .	0
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .	0
all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .	0
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .	0
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .	0
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl .	0
has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .	0
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .	0
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution .	0
a worthy entry into a very difficult genre .	0
in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .	0
it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .	0
[a] rather thinly-conceived movie .	0
stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .	0
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	0
grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length	0
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much .	0
eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer .	0
an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .	0
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .	0
the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .	0
nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .	0
it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .	0
[reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair .	0
an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .	0
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .	0
connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .	0
this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .	0
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .	0
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen .	0
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .	0
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	0
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .	0
majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident .	0
the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .	0
it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .	0
you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping .	0
an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .	0
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .	0
affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .	0
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .	0
a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history .	0
an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected .	0
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .	0
a muted freak-out	0
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .	0
while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .	0
it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .	0
hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .	0
we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	0
boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .	0
salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon .	0
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .	0
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .	0
kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie .	0
cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .	0
the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . .	0
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through .	0
dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .	0
despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy .	0
while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort .	0
it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .	0
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .	0
it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do .	0
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .	0
a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .	0
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .	0
a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china .	0
it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .	0
when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve .	0
ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory .	0
this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is .	0
an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale .	0
been there done that .	0
the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides .	0
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .	0
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .	0
even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .	0
what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey .	0
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .	0
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't .	0
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .	0
an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .	0
dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it .	0
it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .	0
victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance .	0
